    <strong>Please note:</strong>
    <br />
    Uses: In addition to the permitted and discretionary uses noted above, other
    uses, such as Home Occupations, Bed and Breakfast Homes and Inns, Public
    Parks etc. vary across all districts and no changes are proposed to those
    uses.
    <br />
    Max FAR: FAR means Floor Area Ratio which is the total floor area of all
    levels of a buildings on a site, divided by the area of the site. Through
    the current regulations, in order to build the maximum, specific conditions
    must be met such as providing parking underground and/or for specific
    housing types. The proposed changes would allow the maximum FAR when more
    homes are proposed.
    <br />
    Max Height: The maximum building height is calculated to the mid-point of
    the roof. For reference, 14.5 m allows for a 4 storey building.
    <br />
    Min Landscaping Requirement: The minimum landscaping requirement would
    include hard surfaced amenity areas as well as all soft landscaped areas,
    but wouldn't include driveways or surface parking areas.
    <br />
    Setbacks: The numbers above are the smallest permitted, however some of
    these increase as the building gets higher.
